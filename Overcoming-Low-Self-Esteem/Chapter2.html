    <h1>Chapter 2: Understanding Low Self-Esteem</h1>

        <h2>What is low self-esteem and how does it develop</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>The first step to changing things is understanding or insight</li>
    <li>In order to make sense of things or work out what direction to go in, you need a map of the territory.</li>
    <li>Understanding will help you make sense of the thoughts and feelings you have about yourself</li>
    <li>You will be able to use your map to understand what happens on a day to day basis, and even moment by moment basis</li>
    <li>Once you understand how the problem works you will be able to see it play out in real time</li>
    <li>Expecting the worst or putting yourself down, or not allow ing yourself to ask for what you need</li>
    <li>If you can say here i go again, you wont be emersed in your own thoughts or feelings</li>
    <li>Just by saying here i go again youre stepping back from them a little, watching them do what they do without feeling you have to engage with them, or get sucked in and do what they say</li>
    <li>This is like standing next a complex mecahnism watching it work and noticing how the wheels and cogs fit together but not getting caught up in the moving parts  </li>
    <li>You can see what connects to what, whats working as it should be, and also what needs attention and what changes you would like to make </li>
    <li>Give yourself time and understand its a lot less important where the problem comes from than whats keeping it going</li>
    <li>Keep observing your thoughts and feelings and behaviour, even if the past is a puzzle to you</li>
    <li>All the information you need in order for you to find a new kinder more accepting perspective is potenially at your finger tips</li>
    <li>Whats keeping your low self esteem in the here and now that matters and its in your power to change that now</li>
    <li>Self esteem is a sense of our own value or worth and its reflected in our attitudes and beliefs about ourself</li>
    <li>Self esteem can be reflected in using the statement "I am..." and a healthy self esteem would sound something like "I am OK"</li>
    <li>In contrast low self esteem might sound like "I am not OK" or "I am worthless"</li>
    <li>These central statements, which reflect beliefs about yourself, the bottom line</li>
    <li>Because they are the foundations stone of all the thoughts, feelings and actions that make up your day to day experience of self esteem</li>
    <li>We will examine the bottom line and later find a nicer kinder and more accepting alternative</li>
    <li>Having a negative bottom line could have a major inpact in your life in all sorts of ways, </li>
    <li>You might be driving yourself relentlessly, working long hours and wearing yourself out</li>
    <li>You may avoid challanges thinking that you will fail</li>
    <li>You do put other people first instead of ignoring your own needs</li>
    <li>Hide my true self</li>
    <li>Not everyone is effected to the same extent </li>
    <li>Some people may be more resilient and able to cope with challenges without their self-esteem being as affected</li>
    <li>Sometimes their bottom line comes in when there specific situations trigger it, like a job interview</li>
    <li>Other people may have a more pervasive sense of low self-esteem that affects them in many areas of their life</li>
    <li>Their bottom lines can be set off by almost anything, and maybe even make them complety cease up, even with something trivial like missing a bus or burning dinner could be enough to make them feel utterly useless</li>
