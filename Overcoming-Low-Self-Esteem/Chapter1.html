    <h1>Chapter 1: Understanding Low Self-Esteem</h1>
    <h2>Why CBT?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Cognitive therapy focuses on cognitions, or thoughts, and how they influence emotions and behaviors.</li>
    <li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for low self-esteem. It helps individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and beliefs, replacing them with healthier, more positive ones.</li>
    <li>CBT techniques looks at our thoughts and and attitudes and beliefs and how they influence on how we feel and what we do</li>
    <li>CBT can not only help with depression, but anxiety, addiction and eating disorders</li>
    <li>It combines two things: It enables you to understand yourself better and change things about yourself that maybe causing you difficulties</li>
    <li>CBT really addresses the really important issues, a sense of who we are, our attitudes to other people and to life in general, our deepest feelings and urges</li>
    <li>And it does this in a focused and practical way</li>
    <li>CBT helps us to see clearly, how our attitudes and feelings play out in every day life and how the effect the way we think and feel and behave from moment to moment</li>
    <li>It invites us to step back from old patterns of thought and teaches us to see these patterns as habits, which may or may not be helpful</li>
    <li>You will learn to observe, to investigate and question your thinking</li>
    <li>And rather than assuming your beliefs are true, you will learn to test what you believe by doings things differently and then observing the impact of these experiments</li>
    <li>This is the path you will be exploring throughout this book.</li>
    <li>You will begin to find a way of what self-esteem is and how it works, how it develops and what keeps it going</li>
    <li>You will have a chance to find practical ways to help change unhelpful attitudes and beliefs</li>
    <li>And you will be able to develop a new sense of self-respect. and self self-acceptance</li>
    <li>CBT helps you to understand what you think is central to how we react</li>
    <li>Often its the meaning we attach to events, rather than the events themselves, that influences on how we feel and what we do</li>
    <li>Self-esteem reflects on how we feel about ourselves, our opinions of ourselves and these opinions and beliefs are reflected in our everyday thoughts, which in turn influences our feelings and what we do</li>
    <li>If your opinions of yourself is low then your thoughts will be negative, anxious and self-critical.  And the impact of your feelings and how you go about your life will be negative too</li>
    <li>If you could learn to think about more kindly of yourself, then you will think and act differently and all sorts of possibilities could open up for you</li>
    <li>Writing things down can help you to process your thoughts and feelings more effectively.</li>
    <li>Take your time, and be patient with yourself</li>
    <li>Things wont change overnight</li>
    <li>Think this as a gift to yourself, to give yourself self respect and compassion. a step towards accepting your self just as you are</li>
    <li>The voice of low self esteem will do its best to sabotage your efforts, but with persistence and self-compassion, you can overcome it.</li>
    <li>Listening to these talks is taking the first step to questioning the authority of that voice.</li>
    <li>You are giving yourself the opportunity to answer it back.  To give yourself new perspectives and ways of thinking that will suit you better</li>
    <li>Finding a healthy level of self esteem is to have a balanced view</li>
    <li>Knowing like all human beings you have flaws and weaknesses, things you are not very good at, things you regret, things you woould like to improve, but underlying all that you have a fundamental sense that you are ok
    <li>Healthy self esteem doesnt mean to say you think you are gods gift</li>
    <li>It means you have a realistic view of yourself, you know your strengths and weaknesses, you know you are not perfect, but you are ok</li>
    <li>You need to take the time to explore your thoughts and feelings, to understand yourself better, and to develop a more positive self-image.</li>
    <li>You will be asked lots of questions throughout this process, and it's important to engage with them honestly and openly.</li>
    <li>Each of these questions could open up the possibilty to think a fresh</li>
    <li>Itâ€™s important to approach these questions with curiosity and an open mind.</li>
